          <span class="BECCS">BECCS</span> is typically envisioned as the cultivation of one type of crop, a monoculture, over a large
          area <span class="red">(a carbon negative process)</span> and combusting this biomass in a power plant to produce
          electricity. <br> <br> The <span class="red">CO2</span> from the exhaust stream is then diverted and stored, or sequestered, deep
          underground in some sort of geologic formation. Thus, we have the removal of <span class="red">CO2</span> from the
          atmosphere and environment by plants that are grown, which are then burned to make
          electricity, and the CO2 produced from combustion is stored deep underground.

            <span class="red">There are many shortcomings and engineering inefficiencies associated with this process.</span> <br> <br>
      There’s the fact that we are growing plants to burn them in order to produce electricity, which
      may sound strange to many people. <br> <br> That aside, we require A LOT of land, water, and energy for
      plant cultivation. There is also a carbon cost to transporting this biomass to the site of power
      generation––trucks require diesel, which combusts and produces <span class="red">CO2 </span> that is emitted to the
      atmosphere. <br>Finally, there is energy required for separating <span class="red">CO2</span> from the plant exhaust stream.
      Separation is always an energy-intensive process.

            <span class="redpopup red cursor" onclick="toggleSecondPopup()">commonly envisioned BECCS process</span>
            to propose an alternative that addresses these shortcomings. <br> <br> This process relies on agricultural and food waste, which
            require less water, land, and energy intervention. We turn this biomass into charcoal, or biochar,
            a carbon-dense material. We gasify this using the Reverse Boudouard reaction. We add CO2 to
            the biochar at high temperature, enhancing the carbon negativity of this process, and produce
            synthesis gas, which is composed of H2 and CO. CO is commonly thought of as a poison but is
            actually a viable feedstock for a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). Thus, SOFCs can be used to
            produce electricity and a generate a CO2-rich exhaust stream that requires far less energy
            intervention before sequestration.

          <p class="popuptext"> Pyrolysis is the process by which biomass is heated in the absence of oxygen to break down organic structures through a series of complex thermo-chemical pathways. It generates solid, liquid, and gaseous products, and the product distribution varoes with pyrolysis conditions. All three products are valuable and have various commerical applications. In this study, the solid produc, biochar, is of value.</p>

              process, we want to maximize our yield, so this is an interesting result for us to consider.
